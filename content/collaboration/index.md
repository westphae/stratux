## Issues

Submit any issues on my fork's [issues](https://github.com/westphae/stratux/issues) area.
Every flight creates a file in /var/log/sensors_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv, which you can upload.
It might also be helpful to upload /var/log/stratux.log in certain situations.


## Feedback

Please contact me on [Slack](https://stratuxadsb.slack.com/team/bonanzaeric), either with a direct message
or in the [ahrs](https://stratuxadsb.slack.com/messages/ahrs/) channel.

If you're not on Slack, you can use one of the links at left.


## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Steve Sokol of http://openflightsolutions.com for his input, feedback, motivation through his AHRS Challenge, and for providing a prototype AHRS board for testing.  His products are also top notch--highly recommended!

Of course it goes without saying that none of this would be possible without Chris Young and the other stratux developers.
What an awesome project!
